## warning
I ran into some issues with my fork and we're short on time—GitHub only lets you upload 100 files at once.
So my backend stays on the main branch: https://github.com/chartchai-class/project-02-anti-fakenews-cn-alpaca/tree/main
while my frontend is on the Alpaca-patch-1 branch: https://github.com/chartchai-class/project-02-anti-fakenews-cn-alpaca/tree/Alpaca-patch-1
I'm Zhutianyu (ID 20232058), responsible for the frontend. Because of the fork and time limits, I uploaded the frontend files via my teammate's account—hence this note.
